PeopleSearchApp

A simple people search web app that uses .NET CORE 2.2 as the backend for a small web API and an Angular based front-end. Using Angular 5.2.5 and Visual Studio 2019 and a self-created SQLExpress DB that assumes SQLExpress is running locally (could be set to a SQL server instance through the config settings if desired), it incorporates several unit tests via Angular and an NUnit .NET project for one simple test on the API side. The people images are included in the project and loaded into SQL on the first call to the DB.
